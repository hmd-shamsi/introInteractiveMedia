## ***concept***

The midterm of this course required us to implement everything we had learned, ranging from the simplicity of shapes to the complexity of object-oriented programming. I intended to provide the skills I learned throughout these past seven weeks while also implementing my touch of art and creativity. That being said, this required me to code a playable game and make it aesthetically pleasing in its own art style. I chose to aim towards a retro-pixelated black-and-white art style that would make the user delve into a nostalgic experience when playing the game. I decided to get inspired by the most prominent game in video game history, snake. However, in my game (germ-worm), the player is in a black-and-white world where they control a worm in need of collecting germs to reach the highest possible score while exploring the setting available to play, making it a more complex or more manageable experience.

## ***future improvement***

Presenting a worm-customization aspect allowing the user to customize the shape of the worm would be a fun and interactive feature. Additionally, adding a high-score element to possibly implement a competitive aspect to the game would be extremely fun.
