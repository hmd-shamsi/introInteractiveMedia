## ***concept***

The midterm of this course required us to implement everything we had learned, ranging from the simplicity of shapes to the complexity of object-oriented programming. I intended to provide the skills I learned throughout these past seven weeks while also implementing my touch of art and creativity. That being said, this required me to code a playable game and make it aesthetically pleasing in its own art style. I chose to aim towards a retro-pixelated black-and-white art style that would make the user delve into a nostalgic experience when playing the game. I decided to get inspired by the most prominent game in video game history, snake. However, in my game (germ-worm), the player is in a black-and-white world where they control a worm in need of collecting germs to reach the highest possible score while exploring the setting available to play, making it a more complex or more manageable experience.

## ***method***

Initially, having an object, a worm, move through the screen in a manner that is up, down, right, and left was an essential aspect of the game. Then, it was necessary to include a collectible germ that would also serve as a point system. These goals were managed by classifying both the 'worm' and 'germ' and implementing them into arrays and indexes to stylize further the motion presenting an illusion of a worm-like movement. Then, adding a difficulty aspect where the user can freely adjust the difficulty level was an enjoyable feature, as it required sliders, a concept never delved into before. Finally, adding menu and end screens containing instructions would be the icing on the cake. To do that, I fully customized an entire image in Photoshop that compliments the pixelated theme present in the game. These images possessed easy-to-follow instructions such as an icon of arrows with "move," a space bar with "restart, and a click with "start" phrases next to them.

## ***future improvement***

Presenting a worm-customization aspect allowing the user to customize the shape of the worm would be a fun and interactive feature. Additionally, adding a high-score element to possibly implement a competitive aspect to the game would be extremely fun.
